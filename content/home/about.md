WebGPU is an online GPU programming environment used in various online courses offered by the University of Illinois and the IMPACT group.
It is a scalable online GPU programming environment accessible though the web. By removing access to fully-featured system environment and developing targeted labs, WebGPU simplifies management without unduly impacting educational capability. The number of GPUs available through WebGPU can be dramatically fewer than the expected number of concurrent users, and can be dynamically scaled as the course participation changes.
